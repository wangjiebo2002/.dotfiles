# .dotfiles

> This is a collection of my dotfiles. When I have a new mac dev, the first thing is setup my shell based on these dotfiles. Then I can play around other apps or tools.

## Preset

1. Git (you have git in your system)
2. Zsh (you have zsh shell in your system)
3. iTerm2 (install this terminal first)

## Installation

```shell
curl -o- https://raw.githubusercontent.com/countcain/.dotfiles/master/setup.zsh | zsh
```

## Tools

> see zsh/.zshrc. After installation, these tools are in the .dotfiles dir, also accessible in the zsh shell. 

1. zsh with [prezto](https://github.com/countcain/prezto)
